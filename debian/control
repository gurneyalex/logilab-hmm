Description: Hidden Markov Models in  python [dummy package]
 Hmm is a python module providing an implementation of Hidden Markov Model 
 and associated algorithms (Viterbi and Baum-Welsh). It uses Numeric Python 
 to speed up the computations. The implementation is based on 
 _A Tutorial on Hidden Markov Models and Selected Applications in Speech 
 Recognition_, by Lawrence Rabiner, IEEE, 1989.
 .
 This package is an empty dummy package that always depends on
 a package built for Debian's default Python version.
